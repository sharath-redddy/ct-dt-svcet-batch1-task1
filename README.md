Product Failure Analysis

Project Aim: This project aims to analyze machine failure using a dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to explore various features that contribute to product failure, clean and preprocess the data, and identify key factors influencing failure. The final output is a structured dataset saved in an Excel sheet for submission.

Tools & Technologies Used: Programming Language: Python Output Format: Excel (.xlsx)

Result: This analysis provides a structured approach to identifying machine failure trends, highlighting key risk factors, and preparing a refined dataset for further analysis or predictive modeling.
